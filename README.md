# Quantum-Teleportation
This repository showcases a quantum circuit in Qiskit that demonstrates entanglement and conditional operations using a 3-qubit system. It includes the creation of Bell states (beeta 00 state), application of custom unitary gates, and measurement-based conditional transformations, visualized on the Bloch sphere.
Hereâ€™s a concise GitHub repository description based on your code:

### Key Features
- **Bell State Generation**: Entangles qubits 1 and 2 to create a Bell state.
- **Custom State Preparation**: Initializes a custom state on qubit 0 using the U gate with specific parameters.
- **Conditional Operations**: Applies conditional X and Z gates based on qubit measurements, simulating basic teleportation-like behavior.
- **Visualization**: Displays the state evolution and final Bloch sphere representation.

### Getting Started
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
   ```
2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install qiskit matplotlib
   ```
3. **Run the script**:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

This project is ideal for learning about entanglement, quantum gates, and Qiskit basics in a quantum computing context. Contributions are welcome!
