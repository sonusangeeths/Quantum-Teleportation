# Quantum-Teleportation
This repository showcases a quantum circuit in Qiskit that demonstrates entanglement and conditional operations using a 3-qubit system. It includes the creation of Bell states (beeta 00 state), application of custom unitary gates, and measurement-based conditional transformations, visualized on the Bloch sphere.
